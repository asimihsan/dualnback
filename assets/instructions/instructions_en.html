        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>The objective of this game is to memorise sequences of sights and
        sounds. Every three seconds you will see a square appear in one of
        eight possible locations and hear one of eight possible letters.  You
        have to remember whether any of the following have repeated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>only the location of the square (visual).</li>
            <li>only the sound (audio).</li>
            <li>both the location of the square and the sound (both).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is an example of three intervals:</p>
        <img src="instructions/img/example_1.png" />
        <p>When the game starts you have to identify where any of the visual,
        audio, or both, have repeated <strong>1 interval ago</strong>. So, in
        the above example, you can see that:
            <ul>
                <li>the visual has repeated between the first and second
                intervals.</li>
                <li>the audio has repeated between the second and third
                intervals.</li>        
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>After every twenty intervals, the size of the interval within which
        you have to memorise the visual and audio targets may change,
        depending on your performance.</p>
