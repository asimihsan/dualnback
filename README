The Dual N-Back task is a game that stresses the portion of the brain responsible for short-term, working memory. A psychological study has demonstrated that improving one's performance in this task has tranferrable, dosage-dependent gains in other tasks that measure "fluid intelligence" (i.e. get better at this task, become more intelligent).

Please refer to "Improving fluid intelligence with training on working memory" by Jaeggi et. al in PNAS, March 2008, for more information (http://www.pnas.org/content/105/19/6829).

For now, please note that, until I publish this as an app in the Android Market and state otherwise, the entirety of the code base is brittle, under-documented, and subject to massive change without notice.
